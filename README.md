# Machine Learning Models for Prediction of CO2 Emission with Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting CO2 emissions using machine learning models. It includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns in the dataset. The goal is to provide accurate predictions while analyzing the underlying factors affecting CO2 emissions.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization and analysis of the dataset to uncover insights.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Development and evaluation of predictive models for CO2 emissions.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluation of models using metrics such as RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and others.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the following datasets:
1. **CO2 Emission.csv:** Contains data on CO2 emissions and related attributes.
2. **Dataset.csv:** Additional dataset used in the analysis.

## Files
- **CO2 Emission.csv**: Raw data file containing CO2 emission information.
- **Dataset.csv**: Supplementary data for further analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models for Prediction of CO2 Emission with Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the project workflow.
- **Checkpoint.ipynb**: Backup checkpoint file for the main notebook.
